## Introduction

This project follow the ultimate next js course by jsmastery pro. This post documents the changes I made.

## Setup
Follow the setup, at the time of writing, most modules has been updated to accomodate tailwind v4.

For the font, you can simply import inter and space-grotesk from <InlineCode code={"next/font/google"}/> as well, and you don't have to explicitly mentioned the font-weight because they are variable fonts, based on [next js font documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts#google-fonts).
